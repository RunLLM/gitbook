# Data Systems

Aqueduct comes prepackaged with connectors to most common databases and storage systems. Each system has a different authentication mechanism, which you can find in the relevant documentation. You also have access to the [aqueduct-demo-resource.md](aqueduct-demo-resource.md "mention"), which comes pre-installed on every Aqueduct server. This serves as a test data source for you to get familiar with Aqueduct to to run our [example-workflows](../../example-workflows/ "mention").

Here are the systems Aqueduct supports:

* [sql-systems](sql-systems/ "mention")
  * [snowflake.md](sql-systems/snowflake.md "mention")
  * [postgres.md](sql-systems/postgres.md "mention")
  * [mysql.md](sql-systems/mysql.md "mention")
  * [mariadb.md](sql-systems/mariadb.md "mention")
  * [sqlite.md](sql-systems/sqlite.md "mention")
  * [aws-athena.md](sql-systems/aws-athena.md "mention")
  * [aws-redshift.md](sql-systems/aws-redshift.md "mention")
  * [google-bigquery.md](sql-systems/google-bigquery.md "mention")
* [non-sql-systems](non-sql-systems/ "mention")&#x20;
  * [aws-s3.md](non-sql-systems/aws-s3.md "mention")
  * [google-cloud-storage.md](non-sql-systems/google-cloud-storage.md "mention")
  * [mongodb.md](non-sql-systems/mongodb.md "mention")
  * DynamoDB _(coming soon!)_
  * Redis _(coming soon!)_
