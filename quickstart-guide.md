# Quickstart Guide

### Installation and Setup

First things first, we'll install the Aqueduct pip package and start Aqueduct:

```bash
pip3 install aqueduct-ml
aqueduct start
```

Once your server is up and running, you can start building your first workflow. We'll use a simple workflow here just to get ourselves acquainted with how Aqueduct works. We prefer to write our workflows in Jupyter notebooks, but this should work fine from a regular Python interpreter as well.

First, we'll import everything we need and create the Aqueduct client:

```python
from aqueduct import Client, op, metric
import pandas as pd

client = Client()

```

Note that the API key associated with the server can also be found in the output of the `aqueduct start` command.

### Accessing Data

The base data for our workflow is the [hotel reviews dataset](integrations/aqueduct-demo-integration.md)) in the pre-built aqueduct_demo that comes with the Aqueduct server. This code does two things -- (1) it loads a connection to the demo database, and (2) it runs a SQL query against that DB and returns a pointer to the resulting dataset.

```python
demo_db = client.integration("aqueduct_demo")
reviews_table = demo_db.sql("select * from hotel_reviews;")

# You will see the type of `reviews_table` is an Aqueduct TableArtifact.
print(type(reviews_table))

# Calling .get() allows us to retrieve the underlying data from the TableArtifact and
# returns it to you as a Python object.
reviews_table.get()
```

`reviews_table` is an [Artifact](artifacts.md) -- simply a wrapper around some data -- in Aqueduct terminology and will now serve as the base data for our workflow. We can apply Python functions to it in order to transform it.

### Transforming Data

A piece of Python code that transforms an Artifact is called an [Operator](operators.md), which is simply just a decorated Python function. Here, we'll write a simple operator that takes in our reviews table and calculates the length of the review string. It's not too exciting, but it should give you a sense of how Aqueduct works.

```python
@op
def transform_data(reviews):
    '''
    This simple Python function takes in a DataFrame with hotel reviews
    and adds a column called strlen that has the string length of the
    review.    
    '''
    reviews['strlen'] = reviews['review'].str.len()
    return reviews

strlen_table = transform_data(reviews_table)
```

Notice that we added `@op` above our function definition: This tells Aqueduct that we want to run this function as a part of an Aqueduct workflow (in the cloud). A function decorated with `@op` can be called like a regular Python function, and Aqueduct takes note of this call to begin constructing a workflow.

Now that we have our string length operator, we can get a preview of our data by calling `.get()`:

```python
strlen_table.get()
```


### Adding Metrics

We're going to apply a [Metric](metrics-and-checks/metrics-measuring-your-predictions/) to our `strlen_table`, which will calculate a numerical summary of our predictions (in this case, just the mean string length).&#x20;

```python
@metric
def average_strlen(strlen_table):
    return (strlen_table["strlen"]).mean()

avg_strlen = average_strlen(strlen_table)
```
Note that metrics are denoted with the @metric decorator. Metrics can be computed over any operator, and even other metrics.

### Adding Checks

Let's say that we want to make sure the average strlen of hotel reviews never exceeds 250 characters. We can add a [check](metrics-and-checks/checks-ensuring-correctness.md) over the `avg_strlen` metric.

```python
@check(severity="error")
def limit_avg_strlen(avg_strlen):
    return avg_strlen < 250

limit_avg_strlen(avg_strlen)
```

Note that checks are denoted with the @check decorator. Checks can also computed over any operator or metric. Setting the severity to "error" will automatically fail the workflow if this check is ever violated. Check severity can also be set to "warning" (default), which only print a warning message on any violation.

### Saving Data

Finally, we can save the transformed table `strlen_table` back to the Aqueduct demo database. See [here](integrations/using-integrations/) for more details around using integrations.

```python
demo_db.save(strlen_table, table_name="strlen_table", update_mode="replace")
```

Note that this save is not performed until the flow is actually published.

### Publishing the Flow

This creates the flow in Aqueduct. You will receive a URL below that will take you to the Aqueduct UI which will show you the status of your workflow runs, and allow you to inspect the data.

```python
client.publish_flow(name="review_strlen", artifacts=[strlen_table])
```

And we're done! ðŸŽ‰

We've created our first workflow together, and you're off to the races. Here are some next steps:
