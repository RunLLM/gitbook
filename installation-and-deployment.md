# Installation and Deployment

If you'd rather get started with your first workflow, see our [Quickstart Guide](quickstart-guide.md).

This guide will give you a detailed overview for how to install Aqueduct and start the Aqueduct server.&#x20;

* [Installing Aqueduct](installation-and-deployment/installing-aqueduct.md)
* [Starting Aqueduct](installation-and-deployment/starting-aqueduct.md)

Aqueduct can also be configure to run in the cloud, either on AWS EC2 or on Kubernetes, using a Helm Chart:

* [Running on AWS EC2](installation-and-deployment/running-on-aws-ec2.md)
* [Deploying with Helm Chart](installation-and-deployment/deploying-with-helm.md)

Once you have Aqueduct running, you can manage your Python environments using pyenv or Anaconda:

* [Running with Anaconda](installation-and-deployment/running-with-anaconda.md)
* [Running with pyenv](installation-and-deployment/running-with-pyenv.md)

Finally, certain integration (Microsoft SQL Server at MySQL) require special configuration. To use Aqueduct with either of those systems, follow this guide:

* [Configuring Integrations](installation-and-deployment/configuring-integrations.md)
