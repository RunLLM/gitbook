# Integrations

An **Integration** is a connection to an external system that stores data for your business. Data can be read from integrations or written to integrations (or both).

Aqueduct comes with a pre-built set of integrations to common data systems to reduce the manual engineering work needed to deploy a prediction pipeline. We have support for most common relational databases and for AWS S3.

We're constantly working to add support for new integrations, so if there's something you'd like to see, let us know on our community Slack or on [GitHub](https://github.com/aqueducthq/aqueduct/issues/new).

You can play around with our [demo integration](./aqueduct-demo-integration.md). Also check our [Integration Management Quickstart Guide](./quick-start-guide.md) to get familiar with our integration management UI.
