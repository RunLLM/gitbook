# Viewing Data in an Integration

## Base Data Artifacts
These are the data artifacts that exist in the integration that weren't created by an Aqueduct workflow.
### Aqueduct UI
A list and preview of the base data artifacts associated with an integration can be found on the integration's details page. You can bring up the integration details page by:
1. Navigate to the Integrations page.
2. Select the integration of interest from the list of connected integrations in the Integrations page.
3. You have landed on the Integration Details page for the integration you selected.
By selecting the base data artifact on the list of base tables for the integration, you can preview the artifact.

## Aqueduct-Generated Data Artifacts
These are the data artifacts that exist in the integration that were created by an Aqueduct workflow.
### Aqueduct UI
The Aqueduct-generated data artifacts can be found in the data page in the UI. You can access the data page through the Data tab on the left-hand side of the UI. Selecting the data artifact allows you to view more details about the artifact.
