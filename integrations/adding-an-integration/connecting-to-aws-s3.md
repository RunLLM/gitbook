Connecting Aqueduct to AWS S3 requires special configuration to manages AWS IAM (Identiy & Access Management) permissions. This guide will walk you through creating and IAM policy and an IAM role, which Aqueduct will use to connect to your S3 bucket.

### Creating an IAM Policy

1. On your AWS Console, navigate to the [IAM Page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home).
2. Click on `Create Policy`.
3.  Enter the following policy document into the JSON editor. **Make sure to replace `{your-bucket-name}` with the name of the bucket you'd like to connect to Aqueduct.**\
    ****

    ```json
    {
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Action": ["s3:*"],
          "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::{YOUR-BUCKET-NAME}/*"
        },
        {
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Action": ["s3:*"],
          "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::{YOUR-BUCKET-NAME}"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```
4. Assign your policy a unique name and note down that name.

### Creating an IAM Role

1. Return to the [IAM page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home).
2. Click `Create Role`.
3. Under `Trusted Entity Type`, select `AWS Account`.
4. Next, select `Another AWS Account` and enter Aqueduct's AWS account ID, which is `123456789`.
5. Select `Require External ID` and note down the unique ID (a hyphenated sequence of words) generated by the AWS UI.
6. Add your previously created policy to this role.
7. Provide a role name.
8. Once you click enter, you should be given an ARN (an AWS unique ID) for this new role.

### Connect Aqueduct to your S3 Bucket

1. Click on the AWS S3 icon on the Aqueduct UI.
2. Give your S3 connection a unique name and specify which bucket you're connecting to.
3. Enter the external ID created for you under `Creating an IAM Role`.
4. Copy the ARN of the role you created under `Creating an IAM Role` into the final section.

And.. you're done! ðŸŽ‰

We know that wasn't the most pleasant experience, but unfortunately, AWS has quite a complex set of permissioning schemes, and there's not much we can do about it.
