# Connecting to AQS Lambda

Connecting Aqueduct to Lambda requires that the machine running Aqueduct has Docker installed and an ARN for a IAM role with Lambda permissions.&#x20;

Note that in order to use Lambda, you must use
* `AWS S3` as your metadata storage 
*  an external data source (SQLlite is incompatible).&#x20;

For documentation on how to create a IAM role for Lambda, refer to the following:
* [Lambda Executor Role Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-intro-execution-role.html#permissions-executionrole-console)


On the Aqueduct UI, click on the Lambda logo and enter the following information:

* A unique name for your Lambda connection.
* The ARN for the executor role you created.

You should be good to go! Let us know if you run into any issues with your Lambda integrations on our community Slack or on [GitHub](https://github.com/aqueducthq/aqueduct/issues/new).
