# Compute Systems

Aqueduct allows you to run machine learning on any cloud infrastructure you'd like to use.&#x20;

As of [v0.2.7](https://github.com/aqueducthq/aqueduct/releases/tag/v0.2.7), Aqueduct can create resources on-demand for your ML workflows. See more in [on-demand-resources](../on-demand-resources/ "mention").

Here are the compute engines Aqueduct supports:

* [airflow.md](airflow.md "mention")
* [conda.md](conda.md "mention")
* [databricks.md](databricks.md "mention")
* [kubernetes.md](kubernetes.md "mention")
* [aws-lambda.md](aws-lambda.md "mention")
* [apache-spark-on-aws-emr.md](apache-spark-on-aws-emr.md "mention")
* local execution on [aqueduct.md](aqueduct.md "mention")
