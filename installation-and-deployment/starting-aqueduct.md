# Starting Aqueduct

### Starting the Aqueduct Server

Once you've [installed Aqueduct](installing-aqueduct.md) on your machine, the next step is to start the Aqueduct server:

```bash
aqueduct server
```

This will download the latest version of the server binary and start the Aqueduct backend server on your machine -- by default, the server listens on port `8080`. When you run `aqueduct server`, you will some information presented about your server, including an autogenerated API key for your server on the second to last line:

```bash
INFO[0000] Executing query: SELECT version,dirty,name FROM schema_version ORDER BY version DESC LIMIT 1; 
INFO[0000] Creating a user account and a builtin SQLite integration. 
INFO[0000] Executing query: SELECT id,email,organization_id,role,api_key,auth0_id FROM app_user WHERE api_key = $1; with args: [QMLZDO8PT95E0JV371IUAKFBN4S2GHWY] 
INFO[0000] Executing query: SELECT id,organization_id,user_id,service,name,config,created_at,validated FROM integration WHERE organization_id = $1 AND user_id IS NULL; with args: [aqueduct] 
INFO[0000] Executing query: SELECT id,user_id,name,description,schedule,created_at,retention_policy FROM workflow;

		FROM workflow, workflow_dag, workflow_dag_result 
		WHERE workflow.id = workflow_dag.workflow_id AND workflow_dag.id = workflow_dag_result.workflow_dag_id 
		GROUP BY workflow.id) AS workflow_latest_run 
		WHERE workflow.id = workflow_dag.workflow_id AND workflow_dag.id = workflow_dag_result.workflow_dag_id 
		AND workflow.id = workflow_latest_run.id AND workflow_dag_result.created_at = workflow_latest_run.created_at; 
INFO[0000] Executing query: SELECT id,user_id,name,description,schedule,created_at,retention_policy FROM workflow; 
INFO[0000] You can use api key QMLZDO8PT95E0JV371IUAKFBN4S2GHWY to connect to the server 
INFO[0000] 2022-05-24 10:40:28 PM Starting HTTP server on port 8080 
```

Please note down this API key as it will be required to interact with Aqueduct from the SDK and from the UI.

To start the Aqueduct UI, you can run\*:

```bash
aqueduct ui
```

This downloads the latest version of the Aqueduct UI and uses `npm` to start the UI server, which listens on port `3000`. You can now access the Aqueduct UI by visiting http://localhost:3000. When you visit the Aqueduct UI, you will be taken to a landing page, where you will be asked to input the API key created by your server.&#x20;

If you ever forget your API key, you can access it by running the following command **on the same machine where the Aqueduct server is running**:&#x20;

```bash
aqueduct apikey
```

For a full list of commands available in the Aqueduct CLI, please check out the [CLI reference](../api-reference/aqueduct-cli.md).

At this point, you should be ready to go and can create your first workflow. You can use the following code snippet to connect to your new Aqueduct server:

```python
from aqueduct import AqueductClient
client = AqueductClient("<YOUR_API_KEY>", 'localhost:8080')
```

For more details on creating a workflow, see our [Quickstart Guide](../quickstart-guide.md) or our list of [example workflows](../example-workflows/).

\*Note that the Aqueduct UI requires you to have `npm` installed -- please see the [Installation Guide](installing-aqueduct.md) for more details.

### Accessing the UI from an external machine

Sometimes, you may want to run the Aqueduct service on a long-running server and access the UI and server from a separate machine. In order to allow external access, please provide the **public IP address of the machine on which the server is running** as an argument to `aqueduct ui`:

```bash
aqueduct ui <server_public_ip>
```

It's critical that you provide the **public IP address** of the machine if you're running Aqueduct on a cloud server (e.g., on an AWS EC2 instance).&#x20;
