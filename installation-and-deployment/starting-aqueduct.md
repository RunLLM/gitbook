# Starting Aqueduct

### Starting the Aqueduct Server

Once you've [installed Aqueduct](installing-aqueduct.md) on your machine, the next step is to start the Aqueduct server:

```bash
aqueduct start
```

This will download the latest version of the server binary and start the Aqueduct backend server on your machine -- by default, the server listens on port `8080`. When you run `aqueduct server`, you will some information presented about your server, including an autogenerated API key for your server:

```bash
***************************************************
Your API Key: 9NVWLBJ63XAQSU41RMCYKD0ZF87IOH2G

The Web UI and the backend server are accessible at: http://localhost:8080
***************************************************
```

You can now access the Aqueduct UI by visiting http://localhost:8080. When you visit the Aqueduct UI, you will be taken to a landing page, where you will be asked to input the API key created by your server.&#x20;

If you ever forget your API key, you can access it by running the following command **on the same machine where the Aqueduct server is running**:&#x20;

```bash
aqueduct apikey
```

For a full list of commands available in the Aqueduct CLI, please check out the [CLI reference](../api-reference/aqueduct-cli.md).

At this point, you should be ready to go and can create your first workflow. You can use the following code snippet to connect to your new Aqueduct server:

```python
from aqueduct import Client
client = Client("<YOUR_API_KEY>", "localhost:8080")
```

For more details on creating a workflow, see our [Quickstart Guide](../quickstart-guide.md) or our list of [example workflows](../example-workflows/).

\*Note that the Aqueduct UI requires you to have `npm` installed -- please see the [Installation Guide](installing-aqueduct.md) for more details.

### Accessing Aqueduct from an external machine

Sometimes, you may want to run the Aqueduct service on a long-running server and access the UI and server from a separate machine:

```bash
aqueduct start --expose
```
