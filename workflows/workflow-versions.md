# Workflow Versions

Workflows are versioned on every execution. You can see previous versions on by clicking the dropdown menu.

On every execution, Aqueduct automatically captures the code that was executed as well as _all the data that was generated by the workflow_ -- this includes intermediary data artifacts that aren't explicitly saved by the workflow. Aqueduct captures this information on each workflow run in order to help debug workflows, both within an individual execution and across time.&#x20;

By default, the snapshots of intermediary data are stored on your local filesystem. **NOTE**: We are working on making this feature configurable.

Of course, this data can quickly get out of hand, so Aqueduct also automatically prunes version history. The default setting maintains versions for 7 days.&#x20;

**TODO: Add documentation on how to change retention policy.**
