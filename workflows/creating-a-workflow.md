# Creating a Workflow

This guide assumes you've already created an Aqueduct API client. If you haven't done that, please see the [quickstart-guide.md](../quickstart-guide.md "mention") for more details.

### Defining a Workflow

At the root of every workflow is some data. Aqueduct supports loading input data from a variety of sources, but we've found the most common use case is a workflow that starts from a SQL database. We'll use Aqueduct's [aqueduct-demo-integration.md](../integrations/aqueduct-demo-integration.md "mention") in this example.

```python
db = client.integration('aqueduct_demo')
wine_data = db.sql('SELECT * FROM wine;')
```

In the snippet above, we've done two things -- first, we've loaded a connection to the `aqueduct_demo` database. This allows us to access any of the data stored in that database via SQL queries, which is what we do on line 2 -- execute a simple SQL query against `aqueduct_demo`.

Once we have some data, now we can start transforming it. Here, we're going to do something really simple -- we'll take the total acidity of each wine (`volatile_acidity` and `fixed_acidity`) and then we'll calculate the average acidity for each `color` of wine. (If this is a _faux pas_ for wine enthusiasts, forgive us -- we're just trying to make up fun examples with interesting data).

```python
@op
def get_average_acidity(wine_data: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    wine_data['acidity'] = wine_data['fixed_acidity'] + wine_data['volatile_acidity']
    return wine_data.groupby('color').mean('acidity')
```

All of the code we've written here is simple Pandas code. The only change we've made is that we've added the `@op` decorator from the Aqueduct SDK. This tells Aqueduct that when we call the function, as below, to execute it as a part of the workflow that we're currently defining.

```python
acidity_by_group = get_average_acidity(wine_data)
```

Let's say that `acidity_by_group` is a piece of data we care about and will reuse -- for that purpose, we want to save it back to our database. We can specify using the Aqueduct SDK where that data should be saved:

```python
acidity_by_group.save(db.config(table="acidity_by_group"))
```

This tells Aqueduct to save `acidity_by_group` to a table of the same name in the demo database (remember that `db` was a connection we loaded to the Aqueduct demo above) whenever the workflow is run.

For this example, we'll stop here -- we know your workflows are likely much more complex than this, but one operator will do for our purposes. To see real-world examples, check out [example-workflows](../example-workflows/ "mention").

### Previewing a Workflow

You might've noticed that until this point, we haven't actually executed any of the code that you've written. You've defined a SQL query and a function over the results of that SQL query, but you haven't seen the output of anything. This is because workflows in Aqueduct are _lazily defined_ -- you define your workflow, and we execute it when you ask us to.

However, it would be incredibly frustrating if you defined a beautiful workflow and published it... only to find out that you made a typo. To avoid that disappointment, Aqueduct allows you to preview your workflow at every stage of the pipeline by adding a `.get()` method to any data object. This isn't restricted to just the last operator. If you want a view of any intermediary piece of data, you can simply call `.get()`:

```python
wine_data.get() # Shows you a preview of the input wine table.
acidity_by_group.get() # Shows a preview of the results of `get_average_acidity`
```

### Publishing a Workflow

Once we've defined our whole workflow, the final step is to publish it to Aqueduct. Intuitively, the name of the method we'll use for this is `publish_flow`.

```python
flow = client.publish_flow(name='average_acidity', 
                           artifacts=[acidity_by_group],
                           schedule=aqueduct.hourly()
                           )
print(flow.id())
```

There are a few key arguments here, and we'll go through the one by one:

* `name`: This is probably self-explanatory, but every workflow is given a unique name.
* `artifacts`: This tells Aqueduct what all should be included in the workflow. Here, we specify `acidity_by_group`, which tells Aqueduct to also include everything that was used to create that piece of data -- in this case, the input data `wine_data` and the operator `get_average_acidity`.
  * You're, of course, welcome to list out all of the data artifacts in your workflow, but we figured it would be easier to list the outputs you care about.
* `schedule`: This tells us how often you'd like to run your workflow. If you leave this empty, no schedule will be set, and you can set a schedule that executes as quickly as every minute or as rarely as every month. (See [managing-workflow-schedules.md](managing-workflow-schedules.md "mention") for more details.)
* `config`: This tells us which connected engine you'd like to run your workflow. If you leave this empty, the workflow will be executed by Aqueduct engine by default. We currently support Airflow, Kubernetes, and Lambda.

To publish a workflow to Aqueduct executed by different execution engine, we will add in config parameter:

```python
from aqueduct.config import FlowConfig
k8s_integration = client.integration("k8s_integration")
flow = client.publish_flow(name='average_acidity', 
                           artifacts=[acidity_by_group],
                           schedule=aqueduct.hourly(),
                           config = FlowConfig(engine=k8s_integration)
                           )
print(flow.id())
```

Finally, you'll notice that we print `flow.id()` at the end of our workflow. This shows you the UUID assigned to your workflow, which you can use to access the workflow from the Python SDK In the future.

### Viewing a Workflow

Once your workflow's been published, you can go to the Aqueduct UI to see a preview of the workflow. The workflow we've published here will look pretty simple -- a load operator from our demo database, the `wine_data` table, the `get_average_acidity` operator, the resulting `acidity_by_group` table, and the resulting write operator back to the demo database.
