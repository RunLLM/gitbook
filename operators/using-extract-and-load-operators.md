# Using Extract & Load Operators

In addition to Python operators, Aqueduct simplifies the process of reading and writing from data systems.&#x20;

These operators aren't specified as explicit Python functions but rather as API calls within the Aqueduct API -- this is because every data system has its own idiosyncrasies about connection & data organization, which Aqueduct abstracts away on your behalf.&#x20;

For more on how to interact with each individual data system, check out our documentation on using integrations:
