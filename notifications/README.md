# Setting up Notifications
Aqueduct supports sending workflow updates using [Email](./connecting-to-email.md) and [Slack](./connecting-to-slack.md). You can connect to your email account or Slack App as [integration](../integrations/adding-an-integration/README.md). Once the integration is connected, you can configure notifications in Aqueduct settings page. You can also customize these settings on a per-workflow basis as well.

For more details, follow the guide for the notification provide you would like to connect to:
* [Email](./connecting-to-email.md)
* [Slack](./connecting-to-slack.md)
