# Saving an Artifact

Artifacts can be saved to any storage system that Aqueduct connects to by calling the `.save()` method on an Artifact.&#x20;

However, the configuration required to store an Artifact varies from storage system to storage system. For more details on how to write Artifacts to Integrations, please see our documentation on using integrations:
