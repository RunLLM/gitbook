# Operators

Every piece of code in Aqueduct is encapsulated within an **Operator**. Operators take in and return [**Artifacts**](artifacts.md). Currently, Aqueduct supports Python operators and data retrieval operators. We plan to add support for other langauges like R in the future.&#x20;

This guide will walk you through:

* [Creating a Python Operator](operators/creating-a-python-operator.md)
* [Eager vs Lazy Execution](operators/lazy-vs-eager-execution.md)
* [Adding File Dependencies in Python](operators/file-dependencies-in-python.md)
* [Specifying a `requirements.txt`](operators/specifying-a-requirements.txt.md)``
* [Using Extract & Load Operators](operators/using-extract-and-load-operators.md)
